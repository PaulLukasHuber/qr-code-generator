## Introduction

Adding a logo to your QR code transforms a standard black-and-white pattern into a branded communication tool. The QR Code Generator allows you to seamlessly integrate your logo while maintaining the code's scannability. This guide walks you through the process and best practices for optimal results.

## Benefits and Limitations

### Benefits
- **Brand Recognition**: Makes your QR code instantly identifiable
- **Professional Appearance**: Creates a more polished, finished look
- **Trust Indicator**: Helps users recognize your brand before scanning
- **Differentiation**: Distinguishes your QR code from generic ones

### Limitations
- **Reduced Error Correction**: The logo covers part of the QR code data
- **Potential Scanning Issues**: Overly large or complex logos may reduce scanability
- **File Format Constraints**: Some formats work better than others
- **Size Considerations**: The logo must be balanced with QR code size

## Step-by-Step Integration Process

1. **Navigate to the Design Tab**
   - Open the QR Code Generator
   - Create your QR code content first
   - Click on the "Design" tab in the main navigation

2. **Upload Your Logo**
   - Find the "Logo Integration" section
   - Click on the upload area (dashed box)
   - Select your logo file from your device
   - Wait for the upload to complete

3. **Enable Logo Display**
   - After uploading, the logo integration toggle will become active
   - Ensure the toggle is switched ON
   - Your QR code preview will update automatically

4. **Adjust Logo Settings**
   - Use the configuration options to customize your logo's appearance
   - Changes will be reflected in real-time in the preview

5. **Test Before Finalizing**
   - Use your phone to scan the preview before downloading
   - Make adjustments if scanning issues occur
   - Once satisfied, download in your preferred format

## Logo Requirements

### Recommended File Types
- **SVG**: Ideal for crisp scaling and highest quality
- **PNG**: Excellent for logos with transparency
- **JPG/JPEG**: Acceptable for photographic logos
- **GIF**: Supported (static images only)

### Size and Resolution
- **Optimal Dimensions**: 200×200 pixels minimum
- **Resolution**: 72 DPI minimum, 300 DPI recommended for print
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) works best for consistent display

### Design Considerations
- **Transparent Background**: Strongly recommended
- **Negative Space**: Logos with clear shapes and adequate spacing work best
- **Contrast**: High contrast between logo elements improves visibility
- **Simplicity**: Simpler logos tend to integrate better than complex ones
- **File Size**: Keep under 1MB for optimal performance

## Customization Options

### Logo Size
The size slider controls how much of the QR code area your logo occupies:
- **10% - 20%**: Minimal impact on scanability, good for detailed logos
- **20% - 30%**: Balanced visibility and reliability, recommended for most uses
- **30% - 40%**: Maximum visual impact, but higher risk of scanning issues

### Logo Shape Options
Three shape formats are available to match your brand aesthetics:

1. **Square**: 
   - Default rectangle/square format
   - Preserves the full logo design
   - Best for logos with straight edges or important corner details

2. **Rounded Square**: 
   - Softens corners for a more contemporary look
   - Creates a gentle transition between logo and QR code
   - Good balance between square and circular options

3. **Circle**: 
   - Perfect circular crop
   - Ideal for circular logos, icons, or profile pictures
   - Creates a strong visual focal point

### Background Customization
Control the area behind your logo:

- **Toggle On/Off**: Enable or disable the custom background
- **Color Selection**: Choose any color via the color picker or hex code
- **Transparency**: Type "transparent" in the color field for no background
- **Padding**: Background size is automatically calculated based on logo size

## Technical Considerations

### Error Correction Mechanism
QR codes contain redundant data to remain functional even when partially obscured:

- **Error Correction Level H**: Automatically enabled when using logos
- **Recovery Capacity**: 30% of code can be damaged while remaining scannable
- **Data Density**: Higher error correction increases QR code density
- **Non-Adjustable**: This setting cannot be changed when a logo is active

### Logo Placement
- **Center Position**: Logos are automatically centered in the QR code
- **Finder Patterns**: The three corner squares must remain unobstructed
- **Quiet Zone**: The white border around the QR code is preserved automatically

### SVG Support
When using SVG logos:
- Vector quality is maintained in the preview
- When exporting as SVG, the logo maintains its vector properties
- SVG logos typically result in smaller file sizes and crisper results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### QR Code Won't Scan
1. **Reduce Logo Size**: Try setting the logo size to 20% or less
2. **Increase QR Code Size**: Make the QR code larger (300px or more)
3. **Simplify Logo**: Use a simpler version of your logo with fewer details
4. **Increase Contrast**: Ensure high contrast between QR code and logo colors
5. **Check Error Correction**: Verify that error correction level H is active

#### Logo Appears Pixelated
1. **Use Vector Format**: Upload an SVG version of your logo
2. **Higher Resolution**: Use a larger source image (minimum 400×400px)
3. **Quality Settings**: When exporting, use maximum quality settings
4. **Check Preview**: Zoom in to check details before finalizing

#### Background Issues
1. **Color Mismatch**: Ensure background color complements both logo and QR code
2. **Transparency Problems**: For PNG logos, verify the transparency channel is intact
3. **Background Toggle**: Try turning the custom background off entirely

#### Logo Not Showing Correctly
1. **Format Check**: Verify the logo format is supported
2. **File Size**: Ensure the logo file is under 1MB
3. **Reload Application**: Refresh the browser if issues persist
4. **Clear Cache**: Try clearing browser cache and cookies

## Best Practices

### Scanning Reliability
- **Test Multiple Devices**: Scan with several different phones and apps
- **Distance Testing**: Test scanning from various distances (6-36 inches)
- **Lighting Conditions**: Test in different lighting scenarios
- **Print Test**: If for print, test a printed version before mass production

### Design Optimization
- **Logo to QR Ratio**: Keep logo size under 30% for reliable scanning
- **Color Harmony**: Use colors that complement your brand
- **White Space**: Ensure adequate space around the logo (provided automatically)
- **Contrast Check**: Maintain high contrast between logo elements

### Application-Specific Usage
- **Print Materials**: Use higher resolution settings for printed materials
- **Digital Display**: Test onscreen scanning before deployment
- **Small Formats**: For business cards or small prints, keep logos simpler
- **Large Formats**: For posters or billboards, increase QR code size accordingly

## Examples

### Effective Logo Placements
- **Company Logo**: Center placement with 20-25% size
- **App Icon**: Circular placement with 20% size
- **Monogram/Initials**: Small square or circular with 15% size
- **Pictogram**: Simple icon with transparent background at 25% size

### Real-World Applications
- **Business Cards**: Small, crisp logo at 15-20% size
- **Product Packaging**: Medium-sized logo at 20-25% size
- **Marketing Materials**: Prominent logo at 25-30% size
- **Digital Displays**: Optimized logo at 20% size with bright colors
