## QR Code Technology

### Background
QR (Quick Response) codes were developed in 1994 by Denso Wave, a Japanese automotive company subsidiary. Originally designed for tracking parts in vehicle manufacturing, QR codes have evolved into a versatile tool for encoding various types of data.

### How QR Codes Work
QR codes store information in both dimensions (horizontally and vertically), unlike traditional barcodes that store data in one dimension only. This two-dimensional approach allows QR codes to hold significantly more information in a smaller space.

### Reading Process
When a QR code is scanned:
1. The camera captures an image of the code
2. The scanning software identifies the three position detection patterns (finder patterns)
3. The software determines the orientation of the code
4. The software reads the data cells and decodes the binary information
5. Error correction is applied to recover any missing or incorrect data
6. The decoded information is processed according to its format type

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
The QR Code Generator is built using:
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5
- **QR Code Generation**: QRCode.js library
- **UI Components**: Custom components based on shadcn/ui patterns

### Code Structure
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular components for maintainability
- **Context API**: Theme management using React Context
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Accessibility**: ARIA-compliant UI elements

## Error Correction Levels

QR codes include redundant data that allows them to be read even when partially damaged or obscured. Four levels of error correction are available:

| Level | Recovery Capacity | Use Case |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| L (Low) | ~7% damage recovery | Minimal error correction for clean environments |
| M (Medium) | ~15% damage recovery | Standard level for normal use |
| Q (Quartile) | ~25% damage recovery | Enhanced correction for industrial or outdoor use |
| H (High) | ~30% damage recovery | Maximum correction, required for logo integration |

### Impact on QR Code Size
Higher error correction levels require more modules (black/white squares) to store the redundant data, resulting in a denser QR code for the same information.

### Automatic Adjustment
When using logo integration, the application automatically sets the error correction to Level H to ensure scanability despite the logo covering part of the QR code.

## Version and Size Relationship

### QR Code Versions
QR codes range from Version 1 (21×21 modules) to Version 40 (177×177 modules). Each version increases by 4 modules per side.

### Size Selection in the Generator
The QR Code Generator automatically selects the appropriate version based on:
- The amount of data to be encoded
- The selected error correction level
- Any special formatting requirements

The physical size (in pixels) can be adjusted using the size slider without changing the QR code version - this simply scales the entire code.

## Data Capacity

The maximum amount of data a QR code can contain depends on:
1. The type of data (numeric, alphanumeric, binary, kanji)
2. The error correction level used
3. The version of the QR code

Maximum capacity for Version 40 QR codes:

| Data Type | L | M | Q | H |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|
| Numeric | 7,089 | 5,596 | 3,993 | 3,057 |
| Alphanumeric | 4,296 | 3,391 | 2,420 | 1,852 |
| Binary (bytes) | 2,953 | 2,331 | 1,663 | 1,273 |
| Kanji characters | 1,817 | 1,435 | 1,024 | 784 |

The QR Code Generator automatically adjusts the QR code version to accommodate the data while maintaining the selected error correction level.

## QR Code Structure

### Key Components

1. **Finder Patterns**: The three large squares in the corners help scanners locate and orient the QR code.

2. **Alignment Patterns**: Smaller squares that help scanners adjust for distortion. More complex QR codes have more alignment patterns.

3. **Timing Patterns**: Lines of alternating black and white modules that help scanners determine the width of a single module.

4. **Version Information**: For QR codes Version 7 and larger, information about the version is encoded near the finder patterns.

5. **Format Information**: Details about the error correction level and mask pattern used, located adjacent to the finder patterns.

6. **Data and Error Correction**: The remaining area contains the encoded data and error correction codes.

7. **Quiet Zone**: The blank margin around the QR code (minimum 4 modules wide) essential for proper scanning.

## Implementation Details

### QR Code Generation Process

1. **Input Processing**: User-supplied content is validated and formatted according to the selected template.

2. **QR Code Creation**: The QRCode.js library converts the formatted data into a matrix of modules.

3. **Error Correction**: Reed-Solomon error correction codes are added according to the selected level.

4. **Module Rendering**: The matrix is converted to an SVG or canvas representation.

5. **Logo Integration** (if enabled):
   - The QR code is rendered to a canvas
   - The logo is loaded and centered
   - Background processing (if enabled)
   - Shape masking for the logo
   - Combined rendering of QR code with logo

6. **Export Preparation**: The rendered QR code is prepared for download in the selected format.

### Color Processing

The application converts color inputs (hex codes, named colors) to appropriate formats for:
- SVG generation (`fill` attributes)
- Canvas rendering (`fillStyle` property)
- Background processing with alpha channel support

## Export Formats

### SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- **Implementation**: Generated using SVG elements with programmatic attributes
- **Benefits**: Infinite scalability, small file size, perfect for print
- **Structure**: A root `<svg>` element containing shape elements for each module
- **Logo Handling**: SVG logos are embedded with preserved vector properties

### PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
- **Implementation**: Generated using Canvas API and converted to data URL
- **Benefits**: Universal compatibility, preserves transparency
- **Process**: QR code is rendered to an off-screen canvas, then exported as PNG
- **Logo Handling**: Logo is composited onto the canvas before export

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
- **Debouncing**: Input changes are debounced to prevent excessive re-rendering
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are loaded only when needed
- **Memoization**: Expensive calculations are cached and reused
- **Asset Optimization**: Images and SVGs are optimized for fastest loading

### Performance Metrics
- **Initial Load Time**: Typically under 1.5 seconds on broadband connections
- **Interaction Response**: Under 100ms for most UI interactions
- **QR Generation Time**: Under 200ms for standard QR codes, up to 500ms with logo integration
- **Export Time**: Under 100ms for SVG, under 200ms for PNG

## Technical Limitations

### QR Code Limitations
- **Maximum Data Size**: Limited by QR code version (see Data Capacity table)
- **Character Support**: Some special characters may require additional encoding
- **Logo Coverage**: Logo should not obscure more than 30% of the QR code
- **Minimum Size**: QR codes below 100×100 pixels may be difficult to scan

### Application Limitations
- **SVG Export with Logo**: SVG logos in SVG exports may lose some vector properties due to embedding limitations
- **Color Support**: Some gradient or pattern fills may not render correctly
- **Animation**: Animated GIFs or SVGs are not supported as logos
- **Browser Limitations**: Some features may have reduced functionality in older browsers

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- **Chrome/Edge** (version 80+): Full support
- **Firefox** (version 75+): Full support
- **Safari** (version 13.1+): Full support
- **Opera** (version 67+): Full support
- **Mobile Browsers**: Full support on iOS Safari and Android Chrome

### Known Issues
- **Internet Explorer**: Not supported
- **Older Mobile Browsers**: May have issues with logo integration
- **Safari < 13.1**: Limited support for some SVG operations
- **Low-End Devices**: May experience performance issues with complex QR codes
